 I develop a secure wrapper application in plain PHP and MySQL that implements Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) without the use of PHP frameworks. However, I am encouraged to use Composer to incorporate any individual libraries I find appropriate for enhancing security and functionality.
